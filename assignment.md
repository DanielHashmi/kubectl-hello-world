### Homework (self-learning)

* Read official docs: Pods, Namespaces, kubectl basics
* Practice:

  1. Create pod YAML using dry-run
  2. Use `describe` to identify failure reason
  3. Use `logs -p` for previous container (simulate with bad image change)

### Self-assessment checklist

* Can you explain `spec vs status` in 2 minutes?
* Can you debug `ImagePullBackOff` and point to the event line?
